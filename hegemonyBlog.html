        <h3> Blog 9: Digital Hegemonies </h3>
        <p> <a href=""></a>

            Andera Ballatore, Mark Graham and Shilad Sen talk about search results, the differences, origins, and
            digital processes of information generation.
            Billions of internet users rely on search engines for a source of information to make decisions, confirm
            knowledge, and stay up to date with news and goings on.
            Search engines assemble collect and package digital information from all over and can be sent and made
            available to anyone anywhere. But there is a danger because we do not know the origins and perhaps the
            authenticity of information, whether its laden with bias, misinterpreted or false all together.
            The authors conducted a test whereby they researched google search results of “Lagos” and “Rome” on
            different search engines in 188 different countries. They ask themselves two things:
            To what extent is city related information locally produced and diverse, and which cities produce their own
            information and if it is represented by others.
            They identify the differences in unequal digital geographies. They claim their empirical research and
            efforts can help in decreasing digital divide leaving space for democratic information in society.
            In their conclusions, they found that most countries in the global south continue to be defined by a diverse
            range of sources and places. This is good but the issue id that diversity has a bias and those bias
            diversities come from the Global North. How could the global North aim to represent something that is not
            theirs to represent alone have an opinion. Where is the voice of the Global south?
            Sometimes its just that we (Global South) lack the infrastructure. Models show that network connectivity and
            economic development is not enough to produce content about the place more local in google search results.
            All in all, the Article demonstrated that google search results are actively reproducing new forms of
            informational hegemony around the globe. Countries in the global north play an unordinary role in dictating
            and defining digital information in and for the global south.
            Scary.
