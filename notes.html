        <p>Non-semantic elements include div and span. it usually comes with a class. Elements like strong and em are
            too powerfull if you just want to style a spesific passage or word. use span instead.</p>
        <p>structural elements = header, aside, footer and article</p>

            <h3>Semantic Markup (instead od div's)</h3>
            <p>Git just manages and keeps track of changes of code. Svn (old version of git, )</p>

            <p>Parsing, Dom Tree (document object model, its basically a structure.) layout,Paint(css)</p>
            <p>Hypertext Markup Language: a system. types: xml, mathML. Sementics refers to the correct interpretration.
                Semantics is like seperation between presentation and content. We must use semantic markup the way it
                was
                supposed to be used. If you compare pages, it might be identical, but the code markup might not. You can
                use
                a div as an h. etc. Learn how to use which properly. </p>
            <p>http Archive: They found that div id's for header, footer, and nav were being used. Semantic elements:
                Doc
                structure tag, </p>
            Types of doc structure tags: header, footer, main, nav, section, aside(facebook games, adds, wara wara),
            article.

            Textual meaning: the h's, strong(importance/display as bold), mark (highlight), cite (reference), blockquote
            (direct quoteation from another source), q, time (Defines a datetime).
            Correlation Tags: li: list, ul: unordered list, ol:ordered list, Figure, figure caption,

            div vs span. article vs section. An article = Individual, self-contained body of work that we can pull out
            and
            place elsewhere.

                Robots (software) automation, having something to do something so that you dont have to do
                it.(wanderers,
                crawlers are programes that navigate the web automatically) There are types of robots. Malicious and
                Legitimate.
                We dont want bots because your info is at stake.
                How do we control bots?
                create a txt file. robots.txt (spesify who has access) user-agent: Disallow
                Paste link gives you image of place the link leads, This is made possible by "The open Graph Protocol".

            Scope: (important in java. set "this" to what ever you want. )
            Java Attributes : async (java has one thread, far faster CPU bound. ), defer, cross reign.
            Java is not an object oriented language, we can update in real time. declare attributs with a semi colon.
            Perametors, functions, conditions
            Undefned and null, undefined is something that doesnt exist, null is something that exists but is empty.
            Types of statements : Switch, comes with case and Default.
