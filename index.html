				<h3>Semantic Markup</h3>
					<p>Git just manages and keeps track of changes of code. Svn (old version of git, )</p>

					<p>Parsing, Dom Tree (document object model, its basically a structure.) layout,Paint(css)</p>
					<p>Hypertext Markup Language: a system. types: xml, mathML. Sementics refers to the correct interpretration. Semantics is like seperation between presentation and content. We must use semantic markup the way it was supposed to be used. If you compare pages, it might be identical, but the code markup might not. You can use a div as an h. etc. Learn how to use which properly. </p>
					<p>http Archive: They found that div id's  for header, footer, and nav were being used. Semantic elements: Doc structure tag, </p> 
						Types of doc structure tags: header, footer, main, nav, section, aside(facebook games, adds, wara wara), article.

						Textual meaning: the h's, strong(importance/display as bold), mark (highlight), cite (reference), blockquote (direct quoteation from another source), q, time (Defines a datetime).
						Correlation Tags: li: list, ul: unordered list, ol:ordered list, Figure, figure caption, 

						div vs span. article vs section. An article = Individual, self-contained body of work that we can pull out and place elsewhere.
