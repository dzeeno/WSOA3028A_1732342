        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>CSS can become confusing the more you add different rules and commands. It can mess up what you are
            trying to do properly. The amount of time it takes to fix it, if you are not too sure of yourself, is
            ridiculous. Know the syntax and what it does, that will make understanding and working with the cascades
            so much easier.
            Wireframe one was me just fleshing out what a web page looks like, for the title page I focused mainly
            on title, content boxes (for whatever it may be) and a bulletin board because I wanted to be lots of
            random advertising on my characters page. (like some webpages today, how would advertising have looked
            back then. 1887)
            With Wireframe two, as you can see, I decided that I did not need any unnecessary content blocks and
            should focus mainly on overall theme of site, including bulletin boards and images.

            I tried to match up with wireframe one as much as I could, but some things worked better and other
            things had not, it all depends on what works and what does not.</p>

            <p>I chose a sepia like faded look to match the era, so in the background I inserted an old faded diary page
                so that it looks like different pages of a journal.
                I hoped to imitate the 1880's as much as possible through color and imagery. I had to have a hover
                colour
                over the links just to make the link text pop more.

        <h4>Character reflection</h4>
        <p>
            The initial character was confusing, weather he was a machine operator, archaeologist, is he mining? does he
            mine, what exactly is going on with him.
            So, I decided to simplify the character, with more time I would if liked to explore how he could be
            represented better than what he currently is.
            Perhaps having the blogs written from his perspective. Instead of it just being general summaries.
