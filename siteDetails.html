            <p> CSS can become confusing the more you add different rules and commands. It can mess up what you are
                trying to do properly. The amount of time it takes to fix it, if you are not too sure of yourself, is
                ridiculous. Know the syntax and what it does, that will make understanding and working with the cascades
                so much easier.
                Wireframe one was me just fleshing out what a web page looks like, for the title page I focused mainly
                on title, content boxes (for whatever it may be) and a bulletin board because I wanted to be lots of
                random advertising on my characters page. (like some webpages today, how would advertising have looked
                back then. 1887)
                With Wireframe two, as you can see, I decided that I did not need any unnecessary content blocks and
                should focus mainly on overall theme of site, including bulletin boards and images.

                I tried to match up with wireframe one as much as I could, but some things worked better and other
                things had not, it all depends on what works and what does not.
