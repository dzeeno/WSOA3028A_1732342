            <h3>As we may think: A summary of Chapter one</h3>
            <h4>Link to article:</h4>
            <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">As We May Think:
                Vannavader Bush</a>

            <section id="Blog1Paragraphs">
                <p>Before photography and moving pictures, scientists and physicists were on the front lines of
                    technological development and innovation, especially in the crafting of weaponry and gadgets that
                    could
                    be used in warfare. Bush writes that because of their great innovation and technological
                    advancements
                    during war, they now found that there was nowhere to apply their skills in a world of peace.</p>

                <p> Their advancements had far reaching consequences not only politically but socially and
                    economically.If
                    you were in possession of such talented and skilful researchers and their research, you were in an
                    advantages position. It gave control over environments, improved living conditions and knowledge.
                </p>

                <p>Science is also a major contribution to communication and the successful maintenance thereof,between
                    individuals and groups. Science created a platform for people to store, collect and record data/
                    research. In this space it can evolve and grow to which people can reference and contribute,
                    possessing
                    information from early history to recent years and dates. But as Bush says, this becomes continually
                    hard to grasp.</p>

                <p>This is because past ways of transmitting and reviewing knowledge is becoming and has become
                    outdated.As a result, we may lose track of understanding past knowledge because we don’t know how to
                    decipher
                    it.</p>

                <p>During this time the technological things we have today were being developed. For instance,
                    Leibnitz’s Calculator. The labour that went into its development was intensive for they did not have
                    the technology we have today. The production process was complex, unreliable and expensive. But
                    eventually things
                    became easier and economically viable once more inventions were being produced such as the
                    typewriter.

            <h3>Marshall McLuhan : Medium is the message</h3>
            <h4>Link to video :</h4> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImaH51F4HBw">Marshall McLuhan Lecture:
                1977</a>

            <section id="blog2paragraphs">
                <p> Professor of English University of Canada, director of technology. He Makes the point that its not
                    so
                    much the message that has great significance but the medium through which it was told/ made
                    manifest.
                    For example, if you had a phone call you could probably say, wow, its so cool that we can speak to
                    each
                    other like this, being so far away from each other. But remember, the telephone is making this
                    possible.
                    The telephone has affected us all not necessarily the content we share with each other over it.
                    In an interview he was asked if the medium is the message and it doesn’t matter what we say on tv,
                    why
                    are we all here and why am I asking this question.
                    “I said the effect of tv, the message of tv is quite independent of the program. That is there is a
                    huge
                    tech in tv that surrounds you physically. The effect of the program is incidental”.
                    There are various underpinning effects at play besides what we use the tv for. The main point he was
                    emphasising was the far-reaching effects the medium had on people or as he would say the global
                    village.</p>

            <h3>Metadata</h3>

            <p>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata#Use">Metadata</a> is described by Wikipedia as “data
                about
                other data”.
                For example, meta data can be written into photographs. This information would be things like the date
                it
                was taken, the camera version/ model it was taken with, and other descriptive information and keywords.
                Keywords are especially cool because it makes the file/ image easy to identify when searching for it on
                the
                internet.
                Metadata can be created by automated information processing or inputted manually. It is developed and
                applied within collecting institutions. This is all in order to execute search quarries, create and
                manage
                archives online.
                Html allows for descriptive text, keywords, dates and other advanced stuff. You can geotag pages with
                co-ordinates usually contained in the head section of your web page.
                Metadata is also searched through by bots/ WebCrawler’s. Metadata tells the bots how to interact with
                the
                content presented on the web page. There are hostile and Friendly bots, but if one applies a good
                metadata
                structure to their web page, they might prevent sabotage etc.</p>

            <h3> What are URL's</h3>
            <p> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL">URL's</a>
                (Uniform Resource Locator)

                MDN Web docs describe URL’s as being simple addresses of a unique resource on the Web. These resources
                could
                be pages or even just an image. The URL is separated into the Protocol, domain, port, path, parameters
                and
                anchors
                URL’s Start with the https. The http part is the protocol which means that it exchanges or transfers
                data
                around a computer network. The Domain name indicates the site /directory/ IP address. The port usually
                indicated as “:80” indicates the technical gate used to access the resources on the web server. It
                grants
                access to the web server.
                The Path is the location of your folder/file/page indicated by forward slashes. Parameters eg.
                ?key1=value1&key2=value2 is a list of key value pairs. The anchor represents a bookmark</p>

                <p> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/146144480354004">URL's</a>
                    10/03/2020

                    The Following Blog is a Summary and reflection of The Cultural Technology of Clicking" in the
                    hypertext Era: L=Electronic Journalism".


                    Amongst the Technological, social and Political effects of interacting with cyberspace I think the
                    abstract suggests that the user experience of looking at the screen becomes ludic when the act of
                    clicking is involved. And this is the main kind of content we are looking for specifically. Key
                    words: Electronic journalism, Ludic, Internet access.

                    Accessing an electronic lifeworld:

                    They Argue that Electronic interaction combines education with Entertainment in a term they Call
                    "Infotainment". Double identities are constructed. Immersion into the virtual focused on achieving a
                    goal less consequential of that in reality. They say that we are lazy and enjoy instant news.
                    "Internet surfers become empowered recipients very fast". First hand news.

                    escapism

                    Meaning in context is established through involvement in games, watching tv programmes and surfing
                    the net. All of which fit within a narrative space and time.

                    perusing significant goals:

                    "Newspapers offer their readers the satisfaction of pleasurable play, deﬁned intrinsically by
                    reference to entertaining content. They also address their ‘audiences’ role-related (extrinsic)
                    interests in reading. ‘I only pay attention to the news which I think [is] related to me . . .
                    important to me..."

                    Confronting content

                    Different online news emphasises different stories in different ways and it lends some agency to
                    click wherever they want. But the very act of clicking will take you places that you wouldn’t
                    expect, it will take you anywhere.

                    Enjoying aesthetic (screen content)

                    The act of clicking can be and is boring if what you are looking at is plain and generic. Having a
                    pleasing Visual Aesthetic design captures user’s attention and they can find themselves spending
                    hours just clicking away visiting different sites for example.

                    Affirming and distributing political power

                    There are also negative effects of online news preference. Content can be ideologically- infected,
                    you can find yourself being absorbed into political poisoning.

                    Identification and Constructing the self

                    Interacting online can change how we view ourselves and others, momentarily shifting your belifs,
                    ideologies and cultural conventions that you subscribe to in reality.

                    Ludic theory and thought

                    They Argue that Internet usage is ludic (like a game) or "serious escapism" and there are stages of
                    internet usage, Straightaway, easy going, not just for playing and Luminally Ludic.

                    conclusion:

                    "References to ludic use of the internet undermine oppositions between the virtual and the real."
                    Cyber spaces are entertaining sites, often involving pleasure. It encourages escapism whilst
                    maintaining a grasp on reality.

                    "Web pages with news content are able to appropriate their readers’ attention, supporting with
                    cyber-transcending seriousness a subsequent focus beyond the screen, on engaging with work."

                    "Online news sources are read globally and are often situated in a convergent multimedia context
                    (e.g. CNN.com.asia). Here, they result in particularly interesting self-constructions of readers’
                    ethnic and national identity."

                    So, this means that if online news is being read globally from a single source such as CNN that is
                    very specific news. Who's to say it isn’t bias, constructed and or rearranged by those in power for
                    different reasons, be it political or socio economical.
