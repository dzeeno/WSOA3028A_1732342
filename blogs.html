            Blog 8: Gender and race online
            Lisa Nakamura
            The blog revolves around Jane McGonigal and some of her research to investigate and analyse video game
            communities and inequalities. Nakamura basically talks about the internet is a platform that could celebrate
            diversity.
            Virtual communities tend to shut out people associated with racial and gender differences. These communities
            exacerbate the divide between constructed elitist and inferior groups. This is dangerous because these
            scenarios extend into reality and then you have groups of people with certain ideals, psychology and mind
            sets about other groups.
            She concludes that for no apparent reason, even after all these years, it appears that game culture is still
            racist, sexist, and hostile. Games are good for people, but a lot of groups and communities associated with
            games are incredibly toxic. We still struggling with not fitting in tradition based on skill, engagement,
            and collaboration.

            Blog 9: Digital Hegemonies
            Andera Ballatore, Mark Graham and Shilad Sen talk about search results, the differences, origins, and
            digital processes of information generation.
            Billions of internet users rely on search engines for a source of information to make decisions, confirm
            knowledge, and stay up to date with news and goings on.
            Search engines assemble collect and package digital information from all over and can be sent and made
            available to anyone anywhere. But there is a danger because we do not know the origins and perhaps the
            authenticity of information, whether its laden with bias, misinterpreted or false all together.
            The authors conducted a test whereby they researched google search results of “Lagos” and “Rome” on
            different search engines in 188 different countries. They ask themselves two things:
            To what extent is city related information locally produced and diverse, and which cities produce their own
            information and if it is represented by others.
            They identify the differences in unequal digital geographies. They claim their empirical research and
            efforts can help in decreasing digital divide leaving space for democratic information in society.
            In their conclusions, they found that most countries in the global south continue to be defined by a diverse
            range of sources and places. This is good but the issue id that diversity has a bias and those bias
            diversities come from the Global North. How could the global North aim to represent something that is not
            theirs to represent alone have an opinion. Where is the voice of the Global south?
            Sometimes its just that we (Global South) lack the infrastructure. Models show that network connectivity and
            economic development is not enough to produce content about the place more local in google search results.
            All in all, the Article demonstrated that google search results are actively reproducing new forms of
            informational hegemony around the globe. Countries in the global north play an unordinary role in dictating
            and defining digital information in and for the global south.
            Scary.


            Blog 10: The fourth industrial revolution
            Ewan Sutherland
            To say “fourth Industrial revolution” is like swearing for the proletariat. As more and more people look for
            job opportunity let alone job security, we are constantly seeing phenomenal advancements in industrial
            automation and innovation of machines and technology that are taking up what used to be people’s jobs. But
            that is generally the consensus globally.
            Ewan Sutherland talks about Industrial revolution is Africa
            “With the growth of industry in Great Britain and then continental Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth
            centuries, the role of Africa was limited to providing agricultural products and raw materials, such as
            cocoa and coﬀee beans, cotton, rubber, sugar cane, and tobacco, plus gold and diamonds from South Africa”.
            I thought this was an interesting quote because all that we are left with is the institutionalisation of
            what Europe and the North came to teach us. We are left in the scraps of their processes and ideals and are
            expected to make something out of it. I scheme we only trying to keep up with the Global north in a game
            that they created and made us players in and if we do not play then we lose.
            Anyway, the phrase “Auto-cannibalism of business models” sparked my interest. Large corporations are trying
            to come up with strategies to come up with business ideas and make it their own so that they have greater
            control, like Car Manufacturing companies buying other brands and Facebook buying WhatsApp and Instagram.
            Consumers are attracted to what is presented to them in the most convenient way. If a large corporation can
            supply every demand, need, and want, there is no room for the smaller businesses and people trying to make a
            living out of their grind.
            So, what happens is that these large corporations target these small businesses, especially if they are
            successful and supply a demand, and buy their business. For a wealthy price, which probably is nothing to
            them. “Tell your boys they work for meeee now.” Which on the surface, is immoral but morality is ignored and
            substituted with professionalism in the corporate world? So really, it’s just me that’s full of nonsense.
            “Further research is necessary to understand the limitations of the South African government to formulate
            and implement policy necessary to boost its economy.”
            Under skilled workers are at risk of being useless in the face of industrial automation at the same time,
            unemployed people are looking for work.
