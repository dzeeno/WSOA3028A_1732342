                    Blog 8: Gender and race online
                    Lisa Nakamura
                    The blog revolves around Jane McGonigal and some of her research to investigate and analyse video
                    game
                    communities and inequalities. Nakamura basically talks about the internet is a platform that could
                    celebrate
                    diversity.
                    Virtual communities tend to shut out people associated with racial and gender differences. These
                    communities
                    exacerbate the divide between constructed elitist and inferior groups. This is dangerous because
                    these
                    scenarios extend into reality and then you have groups of people with certain ideals, psychology and
                    mind
                    sets about other groups.
                    She concludes that for no apparent reason, even after all these years, it appears that game culture
                    is still
                    racist, sexist, and hostile. Games are good for people, but a lot of groups and communities
                    associated with
                    games are incredibly toxic. We still struggling with not fitting in tradition based on skill,
                    engagement,
                    and collaboration.
