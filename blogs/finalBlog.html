                <h3> Joburg: City on stilts: Mining, history, tremors, gold diggers, opportunists.</h3>
                <p>“40 or more tremors are recorded monthly in South Africa” _ H.C Uzoegbo and K.Li
                    Since 1988, the beginning of the Goldrush in South Africa, we have never stopped mining only just
                    slowed and regulated it. One of the more pertinent questions is what is being done with the
                    leftovers.</p>
                <p>
                    When we talk about mining and Johannesburg, I like to refer to it as “The city on stilts” because
                    there are still numerous tunnels and empty spaces underground that were used during the goldrush and
                    up to today. They are recorded in places surrounding gold mining areas. How these tremors are Gold
                    Mine related is the fact that the tremors have distinct characteristics that differ from natural
                    occurring “tectonic” earthquakes. (Uzoegbo and Li)
                    They can cause structural damage on different buildings and properties. It goes without saying that
                    there is a concern that one day we going to have some serious collapses and the results may be
                    devastating.</p>
                <p> Because of this I thought screen shake would be relevant in this Website. It should not be constant
                    but during certain times. For now, I have it set to shake upon hovering over images. It is
                    representative of our current geological conditions aimed at making the user panic/try to see what
                    is going on. Like how we think, “what’s going on here” when we experience one in reality.
                    I should plant screen shake on random things in the site to mirror the randomness of the actual
                    occurrences. If more time were granted perhaps, I could go more into the direction of underground
                    and have transitions filled with movement, like a rat running through tunnels underground.
                    Shake being a technical feature although is not the main Framework or API. I still want to keep
                    thematic relevance so that the site looks and behaves like a Flipbook / journal.</p>

                <h2><strong>Technicality: turn.js</strong></h2>
                <p> Compatible with jQuery 1.7 and later, turn.js is an API that offers page turning functionality,
                    precisely something I am looking for (pages of a book). It uses a DOM element as a container for all
                    the pages you want in your book.</p>
                <p> I chose this because its able to have many pages, so one could store blogs and create different
                    sections like a magazine. It is optimised to support CSS features like transformation. Its ideal for
                    creating Flipbook type sites. Among the numerous Methods that the script offers is “peel”.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>$ (‘#flipbook’). turn (‘peel’, ‘br’);</h2>
                <p>The above is to show the corner of the page. I found this useful because it is a nice feature to
                    communicate to the user that the page is indeed turn able.
                    Making this website was almost like going back into history and the turning and style of the website
                    was purely Aesthetically charged. It can however be way more interactive.</p>

                    Africa</p>
