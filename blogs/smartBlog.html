                <h3> Blog 11: Smart Tech and Technopolitics</h3>
                <p><a href=""></a>

                    How Smart tech Masks and emerging Era of Corporate Control
                    Jathan Sadowski
                    “Smart is the new norm, you don’t even have to get it, it will come to you.”
                    Jathan writes about these inventions and gadgets being very exciting, neat, cute and convenient, but
                    it also
                    holds dark truths that we tend to overlook.
                    Smart tech adjusts to your routine, preferences. Not only does everything have smart tech or having
                    smart
                    tech be developed for it, but it is in abundance. “Nothing is safe from smartification”.
                    Smart tech also records, collects, and shares information to databases of the corporation that made
                    the
                    device.
                    Consumerism is ever rife and therefore it is always a good or “smart” business model. But people
                    like it
                    they do not think that its evil and therefore we allow smart tech to plug itself into our lives and
                    society.
                    New word unlocked! “Technopolitics”.
                    By studying the “” of society we look at interests, imperatives, and impacts. He Makes three main
                    arguments:
                    1. Smart tech is created by corporates who desire and value technocratic power over values like
                    social goods
                    and democratic rights.
                    2. Smart tech is driven by digital capitalism, data extraction and the explanation in general power.
                    3. It’s a bargain of convenience and connection in exchange for your SOUL ha ha ha ha ha no just
                    kidding,
                    but for a wide range of intended and unknown consequences.
                    And even if you are a passive consumer, you might think “it’s not so bad.” But smart tech has gone
                    viral and
                    people’s information is being spread, shared, and stored. Tech companies are invading our lives and
                    want to
                    know what we had for breakfast and how we use the bathroom.
                    Companies like Cisco and Google want to plugin everyone and everything into a single “mega” network.
                    We
                    should see smart tech as powerful emerging technopolitical regimes of digital capitalism.
                    Damn.
