                    Bonus Blog: jQuery
                    When it comes to attempting to understand JavaScript, jQuery always comes up as this thing that is
                    usually
                    added or
                    must be added to your website. I Understand it to be a script that when active, allows you to
                    perform and
                    access
                    certain things like functions and whatever.
                    Beyond that, it is just a magical script package that can help you perform miracles.
                    SO, what is jQuery? â€˜is it important? How does it do what it does.
                    Well api.jquery.com says that it is a fast, small and feature rich JavaScript library. It allows
                    HTML
                    information/
                    content to be manipulated to handle events, animation, easy to use API.
                    Thereafter the site sent me to the learning centre.
                    For me jQuery was what you needed for plugins, and plugins were going to perform some next level
                    tasks and
                    make your
                    website beautiful. I did not know about affects, Ajax, organisation and performance. But even then,
                    I have
                    installed
                    jQuery and the plugins, but how do I activate those plugins without knowledge of how it operates.
                    My beef with jQuery is that its just there to insert into your website in hopes to maybe use it.
                    I argue that you would need some extensive background knowledge on JavaScript itself, why and how it
                    operates. When
                    I see what it is capable of its magical and genius, to others its pretty straight forward.
                    So the question now is, do you need to know JavaScript to know and understand websites and the
                    development
                    thereof?
                    The Answer is Absolutely. Thorough time would have to be dedicated to understanding the programming
                    language
                    and
                    what you can do with it before we delve into CSS and HTML, because like me, some people can risk
                    assuming
                    they know
                    websites, Surprise.
