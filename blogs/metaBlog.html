        <h3>Metadata</h3>

        <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata#Use">Metadata</a> is described by Wikipedia as “data
            about
            other data”.
            For example, meta data can be written into photographs. This information would be things like the date
            it
            was taken, the camera version/ model it was taken with, and other descriptive information and keywords.
            Keywords are especially cool because it makes the file/ image easy to identify when searching for it on
            the
            internet.
            Metadata can be created by automated information processing or inputted manually. It is developed and
            applied within collecting institutions. This is all in order to execute search quarries, create and
            manage
            archives online.
            Html allows for descriptive text, keywords, dates and other advanced stuff. You can geotag pages with
            co-ordinates usually contained in the head section of your web page.
            Metadata is also searched through by bots/ WebCrawler’s. Metadata tells the bots how to interact with
            the
            content presented on the web page. There are hostile and Friendly bots, but if one applies a good
            metadata
            structure to their web page, they might prevent sabotage etc.</p>
