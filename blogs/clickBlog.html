        <h2> Clicking and Internet Use</h2>

        <p>The Following Blog is a Summary and reflection of The Cultural Technology of Clicking" in the
            hypertext Era: L=Electronic Journalism".</p>


        <p> Amongst the Technological, social and Political effects of interacting with cyberspace I think the
            abstract suggests that the user experience of looking at the screen becomes ludic when the act of
            clicking is involved. And this is the main kind of content we are looking for specifically. Key
            words: Electronic journalism, Ludic, Internet access.</p>

        <h3> Accessing an electronic lifeworld:</h3>

        <p> Accessing an electronic lifeworld:
            They Argue that Electronic interaction combines education with Entertainment in a term they Call
            "Infotainment". Double identities are constructed. Immersion into the virtual focused on achieving a
            goal less consequential of that in reality. They say that we are lazy and enjoy instant news.
            "Internet surfers become empowered recipients very fast". First hand news.</p>

        <h3>escapism</h3>

        <p> Accessing an electronic lifeworld:
            Meaning in context is established through involvement in games, watching tv programmes and surfing
            the net. All of which fit within a narrative space and time.</p>

        <h3> perusing significant goals:</h3>

        <p> Accessing an electronic lifeworld:
            "Newspapers offer their readers the satisfaction of pleasurable play, deﬁned intrinsically by
            reference to entertaining content. They also address their ‘audiences’ role-related (extrinsic)
            interests in reading. ‘I only pay attention to the news which I think [is] related to me . . .
            important to me..."</p>

        <h3> Confronting content</h3>

        <p> Accessing an electronic lifeworld:
            Different online news emphasises different stories in different ways and it lends some agency to
            click wherever they want. But the very act of clicking will take you places that you wouldn’t
            expect, it will take you anywhere.</p>

        <h3> Enjoying aesthetic (screen content)</h3>

        <p> Accessing an electronic lifeworld:
            The act of clicking can be and is boring if what you are looking at is plain and generic. Having a
            pleasing Visual Aesthetic design captures user’s attention and they can find themselves spending
            hours just clicking away visiting different sites for example.</p>

        <h3>Affirming and distributing political power</h3>

        <p> Accessing an electronic lifeworld:
            There are also negative effects of online news preference. Content can be ideologically- infected,
            you can find yourself being absorbed into political poisoning.</p>

        <h3>Identification and Constructing the self</h3>

        <p> Accessing an electronic lifeworld:
            Interacting online can change how we view ourselves and others, momentarily shifting your belifs,
            ideologies and cultural conventions that you subscribe to in reality.</p>

        <h3> Ludic theory and thought</h3>

        <p> Accessing an electronic lifeworld:
            They Argue that Internet usage is ludic (like a game) or "serious escapism" and there are stages of
            internet usage, Straightaway, easy going, not just for playing and Luminally Ludic.</p>

        <h3>conclusion:</h3>

        <p> Accessing an electronic lifeworld:
            "References to ludic use of the internet undermine oppositions between the virtual and the real."
            Cyber spaces are entertaining sites, often involving pleasure. It encourages escapism whilst
            maintaining a grasp on reality.</p>

        <p> Accessing an electronic lifeworld:
            "Web pages with news content are able to appropriate their readers’ attention, supporting with
            cyber-transcending seriousness a subsequent focus beyond the screen, on engaging with work."</p>

        <p> Accessing an electronic lifeworld:
            "Online news sources are read globally and are often situated in a convergent multimedia context
            (e.g. CNN.com.asia). Here, they result in particularly interesting self-constructions of readers’
            ethnic and national identity."</p>

        <p> Accessing an electronic lifeworld:
            So, this means that if online news is being read globally from a single source such as CNN that is
            very specific news. Who's to say it isn’t bias, constructed and or rearranged by those in power for
            different reasons, be it political or socio economical.
