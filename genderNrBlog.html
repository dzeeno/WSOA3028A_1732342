        <h3> Inequalities and online communities</h3>
        <p> <a href="">Gender and Race </a>

            Blog 8: Gender and race online
            Lisa Nakamura
            The blog revolves around Jane McGonigal and some of her research to investigate and analyse video game
            communities and inequalities. Nakamura basically talks about the internet is a platform that could celebrate
            diversity.
            Virtual communities tend to shut out people associated with racial and gender differences. These communities
            exacerbate the divide between constructed elitist and inferior groups. This is dangerous because these
            scenarios extend into reality and then you have groups of people with certain ideals, psychology and mind
            sets about other groups.
            She concludes that for no apparent reason, even after all these years, it appears that game culture is still
            racist, sexist, and hostile. Games are good for people, but a lot of groups and communities associated with
            games are incredibly toxic. We still struggling with not fitting in tradition based on skill, engagement,
            and collaboration.
