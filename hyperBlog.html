        <h3>Blog 12 What’s Hypertext, Noah Wardrip-Fruin</h3>
        <p> <a href="">G </a>

            There are a wide range of answers, but mostly hypertext revolves around the link. Clicking something that
            takes you
            somewhere else, instead of thinking and understanding What Hypertext means in terms of what definitions are
            out
            there, we need to look at the people or person who coined the term. And that was Theodor Holm Nelson.
            Hypertext was talked about in association with fil and media as well. Mr. Nelson released papers on
            “hyper-film” and
            “hyper-media” and theorised it worked hand in hand with hypertext. The Definition of hypertext he gives is
            “a body
            of written =/ pictorial material interconnected in a complex way such that it could not conveniently be
            presented on
            paper.” This makes you think of a code, or pseudo-language, something you need to decipher.
            For hypermedia, he writes that it is the branching or presentations that respond to user interaction. (like
            a game)
            “Systems of prearranges words and pictures explored in stylised ways.” Through this, Wardrip says we can
            relate it
            to what we understand as the web, and that is:
            Hypertext, a term developed by Ted Nelson through his Hypermedia studies, found that it heavily relies on
            link and
            level of detail based.
            Wardrip acknowledges that it is up to us to accept this history, if we do we need to consider that history
            and what
            it says about hyperlinks, media and film.
