                Vannavader Bush</a>

            <section id="Blog1Paragraphs">
                <p>Before photography and moving pictures, scientists and physicists were on the front lines of
                    technological development and innovation, especially in the crafting of weaponry and gadgets that
                    could
                    be used in warfare. Bush writes that because of their great innovation and technological
                    advancements
                    during war, they now found that there was nowhere to apply their skills in a world of peace.</p>

                <p> Their advancements had far reaching consequences not only politically but socially and
                    economically.If
                    you were in possession of such talented and skilful researchers and their research, you were in an
                    advantages position. It gave control over environments, improved living conditions and knowledge.
                </p>

                <p>Science is also a major contribution to communication and the successful maintenance thereof,between
                    individuals and groups. Science created a platform for people to store, collect and record data/
                    research. In this space it can evolve and grow to which people can reference and contribute,
                    possessing
                    information from early history to recent years and dates. But as Bush says, this becomes continually
                    hard to grasp.</p>

                <p>This is because past ways of transmitting and reviewing knowledge is becoming and has become
                    outdated.As a result, we may lose track of understanding past knowledge because we don’t know how to
                    decipher
                    it.</p>

                <p>During this time the technological things we have today were being developed. For instance,
                    Leibnitz’s Calculator. The labour that went into its development was intensive for they did not have
                    the technology we have today. The production process was complex, unreliable and expensive. But
                    eventually things
                    became easier and economically viable once more inventions were being produced such as the
                    typewriter.
