// console.log()
// var a = 1; //old, dont use it.
// let b = 2; // modern var. because dont break the web. 
// const c = 3; // only assign to this variable once. it is safe.
// let c = true;

// 8 Types: Numbers. 1 complex, 7 primitaves. Boolean, null(memory reference set to nothing), undefined(not even a memmory reference), number, Bigint(large numbers) string and symbol. The Object is the complex.

//false, null, 0, "", undefined, [] all, NaN = false faulty values
// =, ==, ===.
//you can also create classes in java. Its amazing because its a reliable container fpr "this" that will be set to an instance of a class. 



//  So Javascripts main functionaly is that its functional. It is executable or allows for certain actions/ procedures to be excuted

// Variables:
/* <script>
    {
        <button>Press me</button>
const button = document.querySelector('button');

button.onclick = function() {
        let name = prompt('What is your name?');
    alert('Hello ' + name + ', nice to see you!');
  }
  }
</script> *


// Theres a button that says Press me. When you click it a prompt shows up that says What is your name with a space for you to input your name.  When you submit, an alert pops up that says nice to see you. We also now use let instead of var because its a more correct way of using js.
