            <p> Professor of English University of Canada, director of technology. He Makes the point that its not
                so
                much the message that has great significance but the medium through which it was told/ made
                manifest.
                For example, if you had a phone call you could probably say, wow, its so cool that we can speak to
                each
                other like this, being so far away from each other. But remember, the telephone is making this
                possible.
                The telephone has affected us all not necessarily the content we share with each other over it.
                In an interview he was asked if the medium is the message and it doesn’t matter what we say on tv,
                why
                are we all here and why am I asking this question.
                “I said the effect of tv, the message of tv is quite independent of the program. That is there is a
                huge
                tech in tv that surrounds you physically. The effect of the program is incidental”.
                There are various underpinning effects at play besides what we use the tv for. The main point he was
                emphasising was the far-reaching effects the medium had on people or as he would say the global
                village.</p>
