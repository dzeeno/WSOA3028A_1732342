        <h3>Blog 10: The fourth industrial revolution </h3>
        <p> <a href="">Gender and Race </a>

            Ewan Sutherland
            To say “fourth Industrial revolution” is like swearing for the proletariat. As more and more people look for
            job opportunity let alone job security, we are constantly seeing phenomenal advancements in industrial
            automation and innovation of machines and technology that are taking up what used to be people’s jobs. But
            that is generally the consensus globally.
            Ewan Sutherland talks about Industrial revolution is Africa
            “With the growth of industry in Great Britain and then continental Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth
            centuries, the role of Africa was limited to providing agricultural products and raw materials, such as
            cocoa and coﬀee beans, cotton, rubber, sugar cane, and tobacco, plus gold and diamonds from South Africa”.
            I thought this was an interesting quote because all that we are left with is the institutionalisation of
            what Europe and the North came to teach us. We are left in the scraps of their processes and ideals and are
            expected to make something out of it. I scheme we only trying to keep up with the Global north in a game
            that they created and made us players in and if we do not play then we lose.
            Anyway, the phrase “Auto-cannibalism of business models” sparked my interest. Large corporations are trying
            to come up with strategies to come up with business ideas and make it their own so that they have greater
            control, like Car Manufacturing companies buying other brands and Facebook buying WhatsApp and Instagram.
            Consumers are attracted to what is presented to them in the most convenient way. If a large corporation can
            supply every demand, need, and want, there is no room for the smaller businesses and people trying to make a
            living out of their grind.
            So, what happens is that these large corporations target these small businesses, especially if they are
            successful and supply a demand, and buy their business. For a wealthy price, which probably is nothing to
            them. “Tell your boys they work for meeee now.” Which on the surface, is immoral but morality is ignored and
            substituted with professionalism in the corporate world? So really, it’s just me that’s full of nonsense.
            “Further research is necessary to understand the limitations of the South African government to formulate
            and implement policy necessary to boost its economy.”
            Under skilled workers are at risk of being useless in the face of industrial automation at the same time,
            unemployed people are looking for work.
