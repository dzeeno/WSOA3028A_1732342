            <h3> What are URL's</h3>

                (Uniform Resource Locator)

                MDN Web docs describe URL’s as being simple addresses of a unique resource on the Web. These resources
                could
                be pages or even just an image. The URL is separated into the Protocol, domain, port, path, parameters
                and
                anchors
                URL’s Start with the https. The http part is the protocol which means that it exchanges or transfers
                data
                around a computer network. The Domain name indicates the site /directory/ IP address. The port usually
                indicated as “:80” indicates the technical gate used to access the resources on the web server. It
                grants
                access to the web server.
                The Path is the location of your folder/file/page indicated by forward slashes. Parameters eg.
                ?key1=value1&key2=value2 is a list of key value pairs. The anchor represents a bookmark</p>
